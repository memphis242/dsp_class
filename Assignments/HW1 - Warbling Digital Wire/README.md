### Summary
This repo is meant to hold any of the C and MATLAB programming I did over the course of my ECE444 - Applied Digital Signal Processing class. I also include some KiCAD files for a little audio amplifier board I used for the last assignment in the class (we were not required to do this, but I wanted to). Even though this class was like climbing Mount Everest in the depths of winter naked, this was easily **one of my favorite classes because of how much I learned and the black magic I encountered along the way**.
