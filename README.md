### Summary
This repo is meant to hold any of the C and MATLAB programming I did over the course of my Applied Digital Signal Processing class (ECE444) here at North Dakota State University. There are also some KiCAD files for a little audio amplifier board I made for the last assignment of the class, which involved making an equalizer FIR filter for some audio processing. Even though this class at times felt like climbing Mount Everest in the depths of winter naked, it is easily one of **my favorite classes of all time**. The challenge was great, I learned a lot, and some serious black magic was witnessed!  

### What Types of Problems Were Encounted In These Classes
We used the FRDM K22F development board from NXP to implement what we learned in lecture onto a DSP. We demonstrated to ourselves digital Fourier Series, DFTs, and slowly worked our way to making the highest order IIR and FIR filters we could.

### Structure of This Repo and How To Navigate Through
There are a lot of MATLAB function files spread all throughout, along with image files and pdfs. This makes the repo as it stands as of 10/30/2021 *pretty messy*. I do not have time to organize it at the moment, but plan to get to it as soon as I can. For now, the best way to browse through the repo is to go through my assignments. The folders have a title to indicate what the assignment was primarily about, at least as far as a lab was concerned.
